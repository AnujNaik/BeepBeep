# BeepBeep
BeepBeep is a custom path planning, following, and correction algorithm based on FIRST Tech Challenge Team 18438 Wolfpack Machina's autonomous algorithms. For now, BeepBeep exists as a simulator-in-progress emulating a mecanum drivetrain, and will soon become an open-source library for use in the FIRST Tech Challenge.
